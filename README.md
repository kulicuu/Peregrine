# Peregrine

A flight-simulator project implemented with Rust and Vulkan.



### Setup

This uses [Vulkano](https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano); follow the "Setup" guide in the Vulkano README, CMake, Ninja, Python installations plus some other platform specific stuff.  


##### Note:

My machine has two GPUs, an integrated one with basic functionality, and a powerful Nvidia Quadro RTX 5000.  I've just noticed that when using the integrated one the terrain does not show up.  I'm developing on the Quadro, and can't guarantee how it will perform on other system configurations.
