# Ash Peregrine


## Project Prototype:  Implement Present Functionality of Peregrine with Ash Instead of Vulkano


Estimate a week, but who knows, whole new interface.  In parallel, will be fulfilling most of reqs for the terrain-server via external device memory extension.  Or I guess this is the requirement we're adding to the prototype on top of the port from the Vulkano Peregrine.
